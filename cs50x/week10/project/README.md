#### Description:
Hello, I'm Walid Safaa, and I'm thrilled to present my final project for CS50 in 2023. Let's delve into the details of my project, which consists of three web-based applications built using Flask, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQLite3.

First Application: Age Calculator
The Age Calculator application offers users a straightforward way to ascertain their current age with precision and ease. Upon inputting their birthdate, the system performs a swift calculation to determine the user's age in years. The result is elegantly displayed, presenting the user's age as a whole number. Simultaneously, the birthdate is securely stored in an SQL database, ensuring data integrity and facilitating seamless integration with the third application.

Second Application: Time Duration Calculator
The Time Duration Calculator is a versatile tool that empowers users to compute the temporal span between two distinct dates. Its user-friendly interface accommodates a broad range of date formats, allowing users to select their desired start and end points. The output is richly informative, offering the duration in an intelligible format. Depending on the span's length, it may express the difference in years, months, weeks, or days. For instance, should a user specify "12-1-2023" and "12-7-2023" as their dates, the output is elegantly conveyed as "The difference is 1 Week," succinctly capturing the temporal separation between the chosen dates.

Third Application: Tracker
The Tracker application represents a comprehensive solution for monitoring and anticipating significant life events. Primarily designed to keep tabs on the user's upcoming birthday, it leverages the data captured by the Age Calculator. The interface seamlessly displays a dynamic countdown timer that consistently updates, maintaining precision down to the second. Users have the flexibility to choose their preferred time units—days, hours, minutes, or seconds—for viewing the countdown timer. This feature applies whether the upcoming birthday falls in the current year or the next, ensuring users are well-prepared to celebrate their special day.

# Key Features:
- An elegant and user-friendly web design crafted with HTML and CSS.
- Enhanced functionality achieved through Python and JavaScript.
- Real-time countdown timer for the next birthday.
- Secure storage of birthdates in an SQL database.
- Automatic reset of the timer each time the page is opened.
- Dark mode toggle for user convenience.

Thanks in advance!
We're excited to celebrate with you.
