--| 161 | Ruth    | 2021 | 7     | 28  | Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot and
-- drive away. If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.

 --| 163 | Raymond | 2021 | 7     | 28  | As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute.
 --In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
 --The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket. |
