If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
I will write queries to find me the average energy, valence, and danceability of a personâ€™s top 100 songs from 2018.

 What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
 I would track how many times s/he listens to each song
